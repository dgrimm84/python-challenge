Module 3 Python Challenge - Daniel Grimm

This repository contains two directories:  PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank - this consists of a main.py document which contains the main python code.  This code reads the budget_data.csv file in the Resources folder, analyzes the data, makes calculations, and prints these summary calculations to the terminal screen as well as an exported text file named "budget_analysis.txt" located in the analysis folder. 

  The main purpose of this python code is to calculate and display the number of months in this date range, the total value of all profits and losses, the average       change over this period of profts and losses deltas, and the greatest net increase and greatest net decrease in these changes.  

PyPoll - this consists of a main.py document which contains the main python code.  This code reads the "election_data.csv" file in the resources folder, analyzes the data, makes calculations, and prints the summary to the terminal screen as well as an exported text file named "election_analysis.txt" located in the analysis folder.

  The main purposes of this python code is to capture the names of all participants in this election, calculate how many total votes were cast, calculate how many   votes each participant receieved, calculate the percentage of the total vote each person received, and to report the winner based on this information.

Outside resources were used to clarify syntax that was not functioning properly such as:  Stack Overflow, FreeCodeDump, and some Reddit threads.  No code was copied & pasted into this project, but some was modified and used to fit into this code.
